# Marlowe Rust SDK
This repository is made up of two crates. 
1. The `marlowe_client` directory that is mainly autogenerated.
2. The `marlowe_sdk` directory where the actual Marlowe Runtime REST API SDK is located.

To interact in a more low level way, use the crate located at`marlowe_client`.

To interact through the SDK, use the crate located at `marlowe_sdk`.

# Development
To update the SDK to newer versions of the Marlowe Runtime REST API, replace the`marlowe_sdk/openapi.json` contents with the specs of the newest version.

The CI/CD has the steps for automatically generating the rust code for the `marlowe_client`. Take into account that the automatically generated code has a lot of issues. Please run tests when trying to update the generated code. 

# Versioning
Refer to the releases page  to check the API version that the SDK is compatible with.
